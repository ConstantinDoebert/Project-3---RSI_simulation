A simple trading simulation relying on the RS-Indicator.
--------------------------------------------------------
Idea:<br/>
  * Buy the stock, if the RSI is below base line.<br/>
  * Sell the stock, if the RSI is above top line.<br/>
  * For 14 trading days interval: 30-70 split.<br/><br/>

Further improvements:<br/>
  * Include transcation fees and spread costs.<br/>
  * Include different strategies based on volatility and implied volatility.<br/>
  * In case of indices: consider economic data for sentiment analysis.<br/>
  * Analysis of movements in option interest.<br/>
  * Further optimization; simulating different parameters.<br/><br/>

Methods for evaluating success and meaningfulness:<br/>
  * Backtesting with historical data.<br/>
  -> If it looks promissing: Evaluation and optimization.<br/>
  * Realworld application with moderate funding.
