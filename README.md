A simple trading simulation relying on the RS-Indicator.
--------------------------------------------------------
Idea:<br/>
  a) Buy the stock, if the RSI is below base line.<br/>
  b) Sell the stock, if the RSI is above top line.<br/><br/>

Further improvements:<br/>
  I) Include transcation fees and spread costs<br/>
  II) Include different strategies based on volatility and implied volatility<br/>
  III) In case of indices: consider economic data for sentiment analysis<br/>
  IV) Analysis of movements in option interest<br/>
  V) Further optimization; simulating different parameters<br/><br/>

Method for evaluating success and meaningfulness:<br/>
  a) Backtesting with historical data<br/>
  -> If it looks promissing: Evaluation and optimization<br/>
  b) Realword application with moderate funding
