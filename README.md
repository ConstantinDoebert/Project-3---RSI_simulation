A simple trading simulation relying on the RS-Indicator.
--------------------------------------------------------
Idea:
  a) Buy the stock, if the RSI is below base line.
  b) Sell the stock, if the RSI is above top line.

Further improvements:
  I) Include transcation fees and spread costs
  II) Include different strategies based on volatility and implied volatility
  III) In case of indices: consider economic data for sentiment analysis
  IV) Analysis of movements in option interest
  V) Further optimization; simulating different parameters

Method for evaluating success and meaningfulness:
  a) Backtesting with historical data
  -> If it looks promissing: Evaluation and optimization
  b) Realword application with moderate funding
